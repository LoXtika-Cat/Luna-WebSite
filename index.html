            <p>Multifunctional bot for listening to music. 
                Our bot has a large number of settings and commands that make it easier to handle. 
                The sound before being reproduced undergoes versatile processing from noise and interference. 
                Easy to use track search interface will allow you to not search for the exact name and artist, instead you can find a track, remembering only somewhat close to name or artist. 
                Not enough bass? This can be fixed with the "bassboost" feature! Liked the track? Save it to your PM using just one command! 
                Do you play the same list of tracks all the time? Use "loopqueue" to loop entire queue! We welcome your feedback, suggestions, and reports about the work of our bot.<br><br>
